# Weather DashBoard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a deployable web application that will show you the weather for a city after you enter it. It will give you the current weather associated ih the current date and it will return temperature, wind, humidity and UV index. It will also display all of those same measurements except for the UV index for the next five days. It will save your recent searches if they were valid cities and keep them in local storage, you can click on their buttons and it will display info for that city.
